Day 1: Data Types

Objective
Today, we're discussing data types. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional
video!

Task
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables , , and are already declared and initialized for
you. You must:
1. Declare variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2. Read lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below)
and initialize your variables.
3. Use the operator to perform the following operations:
1. Print the sum of plus your int variable on a new line.
2. Print the sum of plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
3. Concatenate with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

Note: If you are using a language that doesn't support using for string concatenation (e.g.: C), you can
just print one variable immediately following the other on the same line. The string provided in your editor
must be printed first, immediately followed by the string you read as input.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer that you must sum with .
The second line contains a double that you must sum with .
The third line contains a string that you must concatenate with .

Output Format
Print the sum of both integers on the first line, the sum of both doubles (scaled to decimal place) on the
second line, and then the two concatenated strings on the third line.

# Solution
i2 = int(input())
d2 = float(input())
s2 = str(input())
print(i + i2)
print(d + d2)
print(s + s2)
